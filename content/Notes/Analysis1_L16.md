## Absolute and relative definitions

### Sequential compactness

#### Absolute definition for metric space $X$

>[!Definition] Definition 1
>Every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence.

#### Relative definition for $E\subset$ metric space $X$

>[!Definition] Definition 2
>Every sequence in $E$ has a convergent subsequence with limit in $E$.

#### Equivalence

$E$ is sequentially compact as per definition 1 as a metric space in its own right $\iff$ $E$ is a sequentially compact subset of $X$ as per 2.

Thus, sequential compactness is intrinsic, i.e, if $E\subset Y\subset X$, 
$E$ is sequentially compact in $X$ $\iff$ $E$ is sequentially compact in $Y$ $\iff$ $E$ is sequentially compact.

### Limit point compactness

#### Absolute definition for metric space $X$

>[!Definition] Definition 1
>Every infinite $S\subset X$ has a limit point.

#### Relative definition for $E\subset$ metric space $X$

>[!Definition] Definition 2
>Every infinite $S\subset E$ has a limit point in $E$. 

#### Equivalence

Same argument as in sequential compactness.

## Examples of compact sets

### Finite sets

Any set $S$ of finite cardinality is compact. Any sequence in $S$ must have at least one element of $S$ repeating infinitely many times - take the subsequence required by sequential compactness to be a constant sequence of just this element. The condition for limit point compactness is vacuously true, since no infinite subset of $S$ exists.
### The Cantor set

The Cantor set is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}$. It follows from the [[#Heine Borel Theorem]] that it is compact.
### Open intervals in R (non example)

$(a, b)$, $[a, b)$, $(a, b]$, and $\mathbb{R}$ are *not* compact. It is easy to find sequences in these sets which violate the definition of sequential compactness. Take the set of terms of these sequences to violate the definition of limit point compactness.
### Closed intervals in R

$[a, b]$ is compact. 

**Sequential compactness:** Consider a sequence in $[a, b]$. We know it has a convergent subsequence, courtesy the [[Subsequences#Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem|Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem]]. The point to which this subsequence converges is a limit point of $[a, b]$, and must be contained in $[a, b]$ since $[a, b]$ is a closed set. 

**Limit point compactness:** Showing this follows a very similar strategy to Abbot's proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem (bisection search). Given an infinite $S$, successively bisect the intervals, continuing with the half having infinite elements of $S$ at each step. This should give us nested intervals of the form $[a_{0}, b_{0}], [a_{1}, b_{1}], [a_{2}, b_{2}], \dots$, where the length of $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ is $|a_{0}-b_{0}|/2^{n}$ ($\to 0$), and $|[a_{n}, b_{n}]\cap S|=\infty$. From the [[The real field#Nested interval property|nested interval property]], we know that $\bigcap_{i\geq 0}[a_{i}, b_{i}]$ is non-empty (in fact, we know it is a singleton, but we just need it to be non-empty for this to work). Let $p$ be an element in this intersection. Let $\epsilon>0$. We can find $k$ such that the length of $[a_{k}, b_{k}]<\epsilon$. Thus, $[a_{k}, b_{k}]\subset(p-\epsilon, p+\epsilon)$. So, any $\epsilon$ ball around $p$ contains elements of $S$, i.e, $p\in[a, b]$ is a limit point of $S$. 

It follows that "closed boxes" in $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ are limit point compact. This can be shown using an analogue of bisection search in $\mathbb{R}^{k}$, where you divide the set into $2^{k}$ sections in each step. We will skip showing these are sequentially compact (follows trivially from BWT), since the two notions are actually equivalent, as we will now show.

## Equivalence of sequential and limit point compactness

>[!Theorem]
>Let $X$ be a metric space. Then, $X$ is sequentially compact $\iff$ $X$ is limit point compact.

>**Proof of $\implies$**
>Let $S\subset X$, $|S|=\infty$. We want to show that $S$ has a limit point in $X$. Take $T=\{ x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots \}\subset S$. Since $X$ is sequentially compact, we can extract a sequence $x_{k_{1}}, x_{k_{2}}, \dots$ from $T$ such that $(x_{k_{n}})\to p\in X$. Observe that $p$ is a limit point of $T$, and hence of $S$. ❏
>
>**Proof of $\Longleftarrow$**
>Let $(p_{n})$ be a sequence in $X$. We want to show that some subsequence of $(p_{n})$ converges to a point in $X$. 
>Let $S=\{ p_{n}\ |\ n\in \mathbb{N} \}$. If $S$ is finite, i.e, $(p_{n})$ has a finite number of distinct terms, a single element must repeat infinite times in the sequence. Let the constant sequence of this element be the subsequence required, and we are done.
>If $S$ is infinite, since $X$ is limit point compact, $S$ must have a limit point in $X$. Call it $p$. Define a sequence of $\epsilon$'s: $(\epsilon_{n})=\left( \frac{1}{2^{n}} \right)$. Construct a subsequence $(p_{k_{n}})$ of $(p_{n})$ like so: Let $p_{k_{1}}$ be any point in $B_{\epsilon_{1}}(p, S)\setminus \{ p \}$, and let $p_{k_{n+1}}$ be any point such that $k_{n+1}>k_{n}$ and $p_{k_{n+1}}\in B_{\epsilon_{n+1}}(p, S)\setminus \{ p \}$ (such a $k_{n+1}$ must exist since every deleted neighborhood of $p$ contains infinitely many elements of $S$). Then, $(p_{n_{k}})\to p$ since $(\epsilon_{n})\to 0$. ❏


>[!Info]
>We have not yet shown that open cover compactness is equivalent to limit point/sequential compactness, so replace every instance of compact with limit point compact or sequentially compact in the following theorems and proofs if you're reading these lecture notes in order.

## Image of a compact set under a continuous function

>[!Theorem]
>if $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, and $X$ is compact, $f(X)$ is compact.

>**Proof**
>Consider a sequence $f(x_{1}), f(x_{2}), \dots$ in $f(X)$. $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots$ is a sequence in $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots$ has a subsequence $(x_{k_{n}})\to p\in X$. Since $f$ is continuous, it [[Analysis1_L15#Continuous functions map convergent sequences to convergent sequences|follows]] that $f(x_{k_{n}})\to f(p)\in f(X)$. ❏

## Characterization of compact sets

Rudin, 2.34

>[!Theorem]
>Every compact set $C$ in a metric space $X$ is closed in $X$ and bounded.

>**Proof** 
>Assume $C$ is not closed. Then, $|C|=\infty$, and $C$ has a limit point $p$ outside $C$. There exists a sequence $(p_{n})$ in $C$ that converges to $p$. Since every subsequence of $(p_{n})$ also converges to $p$, $(p_{n})$ has no subsequence that converges to a point in $C$, contradicting the hypothesis that $C$ is compact. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$
>Suppose $C$ is unbounded. Pick $x_{0}\in C$. Pick $x_{n+1}$ such that $d(x_{0}, x_{n+1})>1+d(x_{0}, x_{n})$. This construction results in the distance between any two terms in $(x_{n})$ being greater than 1. Thus, there does not exist an $N$ such that for all $n\ge N$, all $x_{n}$ lie in a ball of radius $\frac{1}{2}$. So, no subsequence of $(x_{n})$ converges, contradicting the hypothesis that $C$ is compact. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$ ❏

## Extreme value theorem

Consider a continuous function $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$, where $X$ is a compact set. We know now that this implies $f(X)$ is compact, which in turn implies $f(X)$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded. Since $f(X)$ is non-empty and bounded, it must have a [[Bounds#Supremum and infimum|supremum and infimum]], when then must be [[Analysis1_L15#Closed sets in $ mathbb{R}$ contain their suprema|contained]] in $f(X)$ since it is closed. Hence the theorem.

>[!Theorem] Extreme value theorem
>A continuous function from a non-empty compact space to a subset of the real numbers attains a maximum and a minimum value.

## Closed subsets of compact sets are compact

Rudin, 2.35

>[!Theorem]
>If $X$ is compact, $C$ is closed in $X$ $\implies$ $C$ is compact.

>**Proof**
>Consider a infinite subset $S\subset C$. Since $S\subset X$, $S$ has a limit point $p$ in $X$. However, a limit point of $S$ is also a limit point of $C$, which contains all of its limit points since it is closed. Thus, $p \in C$. ❏

## Heine Borel Theorem

>[!Theorem]
>Let $C$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Then, $C$ is compact $\iff$ $C$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}$ and bounded.

>**Proof of $\implies$** 
>Follows from the [[#Characterization of compact sets]].
>
>**Proof of $\Longleftarrow$**
>Since $C$ is bounded, $C\subset[-M, M]$ for some $M$. Now, $C=[-M, M]\cap C$, and thus $C$ is closed in $[-M, M]$ ([[Analysis1_L15#Subspace topology|Subspace topology]]). We have previously [[#Closed intervals in R|shown]] that closed intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ are compact, so $[-M, M]$ is compact. It follows form the [[#Closed subsets of compact sets are compact|previous theorem]] that $C$ is compact. ❏

>[!Warning]
>In general, $X$ is closed and bounded $\not\implies$ $X$ is compact.

>[!Important]
>While stated for $\mathbb{R}$, the Heine Borel theorem is valid for $\mathbb{R}^{k}$. It is easy to show.
