>[!Info]- Notation
>- $B_{\delta}(p, E)$ is an open ball of radius $\delta$ centered at $p$ in a metric space $E$. If $X$ is a superset of $E$, $B_{\delta}(p, E)\equiv B_{\delta}(p, X)\cap E$. 
>- $\sqcup$ denotes disjoint union.
>- $\overline{P}$ denotes the closure of $P$ in the contextually appropriate space.

- [ ] No set S can be in bijection with its power set (classic Cantor diagonalization argument)
- [ ] Try to prove the Schroder-Bernstein theorem: if there is an injection from S to T and an injection from T to S, then there is a bijection between S and T. Then locate a proof and see if you can read a little and complete the rest. (Check abbot)
- [ ] $a_{0}\ge a_{1}\ge \dots \ge 0$. $\lim_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=0$. Show that $\sum(-1)^{n}a_{n}$ converges.
- [ ] Fixed point theorem
      $M$ is a complete metric space.
      $T:M\to M$ is continuous.
      $d(T(p), T(q))<k(d(p,q))$, where $k$ is a constant less than 1.
      Then, $T$ has a unique fixed point (If $T(x_{0}) = x_{0}$, then, $x_{0}$ is called a fixed point).
      It is easy to see that at most one fixed point can exist for $T$ given the distance inequality.
