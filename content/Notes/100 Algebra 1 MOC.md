	- Every fdvsp has a basis.
	- Any two bases of an fdvsp have same cardinality, i.e, the cardinality of a basis is an *invariant* of an fdvsp.
- [[Algebra1_L9]] ✅ 
- [[Algebra1_L10]] ✅
- [[Algebra1_L11]] ✅
- [[Algebra1_L12]] (unfinished)

>- [[Algebra1_L1]] Intro, Vector spaces, Fields.
>- [[Algebra1_L2]] Matrices, Variables vs equations table
>- [[Algebra1_L3]] Row operations, REF, RREF, pivots, free variables, conditions for $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ being inconsistent and consistent
>- [[Algebra1_L4]] 
>	- Given $\mathbf{v}$ s.t $A\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{b}$, any other $\mathbf{w}$ s.t $A\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{b}$ can be expressed as $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{y}\in\text{Ker }A$. 
>	- requirements for injectivity and surjectivity in terms of number of pivots
>	- matrix representation of row ops
>	- matrix multiplication as a function

>- [[Algebra1_L5]]
>	- injectivity and surjectivity requirements in terms of number of rows and columns
>	- Invertible matrices
>	- If $A$ is invertible, its inverse must be unique
