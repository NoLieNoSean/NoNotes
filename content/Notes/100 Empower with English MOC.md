Describe the setting of the poem with focus on imagery.

disease, gloomy, dark
despairing, Irish, desolate

By rocky lane and fen;

works to exhaustion, hardworking
"The old priest Peter Gilligan
Was weary night and day;"


religious, compassionate, god loving, grateful
"'He Who hath made the night of stars
For souls who tire and bleed,
Sent one of His great angels down
To help me in my need.
'He Who is wrapped in purple robes,
With planets in His care,
Had pity on the least of things
Asleep upon a chair."


**character sketch of mariner**

captivating: 
"He holds him with his glittering eye—
The Wedding-Guest stood still,
And listens like a three years' child:
The Mariner hath his will."

'There was a ship,' quoth he.

From the fiends, that plague thee thus!—
Why look'st thou so?'—With my cross-bow
I shot the ALBATROSS."
