### A theory of institutions

Definition. An *institution* is a body of people with an internal structure which works to bring the the world to a certain state (its alignment), and is empowered as an entity by society to some extent to pursue this state, i.e, allowed to take actions that individuals (both inside and outside of the institution) are not.

Thus, a constructor of an institution would take the following arguments: (set of people in the institution, internal structure of the institution, the alignment of the institution, the power vested in the institution by society). Note that all these properties are mutable over time.

People who might be impacted by the actions of the institution are called the *stakeholders* of the institution. The set of stakeholders is a function of the institution's alignment and power. 

An institution is said to have turned *malevolent* when its alignment mutates enough to oppose its initial alignment.

An institution's *effectiveness* is the ratio of the rate at which it is pursuing its alignment to the maximum rate at which it could be doing so, given its powers.

An institution is said to have *collapsed* when


Assuming a proper initial alignment, we need to set up institutions such that they
1. sufficiently empowered to pursue their alignments. Take the UN's inability to do anything but whine about the situation in Gaza as a counterexample (target 11, 3, 6).
2. are transparent to all stakeholders, and allow for the participation of all stakeholders (target 8, 12, 10, 6).
3. are resilient to collapse, making them stick around for long once they are established
4. are as less likely as possible to turn malevolent and misuse their powers (target 5)
5. have checks and balances to stop them from inflicting significant damage if they do turn malevolent.

When does an institution turn malevolent? 


**1. Institutional Design & Power Balance**

• **Institutional Empowerment**: Look into political theory on the **separation of powers**, **subsidiarity**, and **federalism**. Authors like **James Madison** and **Montesquieu** are critical to understanding these foundational ideas. The design of institutions that can act effectively when necessary, but not overstep, draws heavily from checks and balances. A deeper dive into **constitutional theory** can help illuminate how different models (like presidential vs. parliamentary systems) handle empowerment.

• **International Law & Governance**: For international structures like the UN, studying **global governance theory** is key. You might find works on **realism** (power dynamics in global politics) and **liberal institutionalism** (how institutions can influence state behavior) useful. **Anne-Marie Slaughter’s “A New World Order”** explores how networks of institutions might cooperate more effectively at a global level.

**2. Resilience of Institutions**

• The longevity and adaptability of institutions can be studied through the lens of **institutional economics** and **political sociology**. Douglass North’s **“Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance”** looks at how institutions evolve and stick around. You can also look at **historical examples** of resilient institutions, like the **British monarchy**, the **Catholic Church**, and long-standing republics like **Switzerland**.

• **Resilience in International Institutions**: Investigate how international bodies like the **European Union** and the **World Bank** have survived various crises. The concept of **path dependence** explains how initial choices in institutional design heavily influence their future trajectory.

**3. Preventing Malevolence**

• **Game theory** and **behavioral economics** offer insights into how systems can be designed to prevent power from being misused. Concepts like **incentive structures** and **accountability mechanisms** are critical here. Read about the **principal-agent problem**, where agents (institutions) might act against the interests of the principals (citizens or states).

• The **Federalist Papers**, especially Madison’s No. 10 and 51, argue for the idea of **factions** and how pluralism can be used to prevent tyranny. Modern applications of these ideas can be seen in **democratic peace theory** and the structure of **federal systems** that disperse power across levels.

**4. Limiting Damage from Failure**

• To minimize the risk of malevolent actors within institutions, you can study **institutional redundancy** and **distributed systems**. These fields explore how decentralized systems, where no single institution has too much power, can prevent catastrophic failure. The notion of **polycentric governance** (advanced by Elinor Ostrom) looks at how multiple, overlapping institutions can work together to limit risks of abuse.
